# Vision Statment 
The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is an android application that makes the flight booking process for airline travellers as easy and efficient as possible as it contains fare comparison capabilties, multiple airline schedules and other time and money saving features.


# Description
The system will feature a very easy to use search panel that allows travellers to search for flights in real time. They will be able to select their departing and arrival cities of choice accompanied with their airport codes for accuracy in city names allowing the travellers to only be able to see cities that are serviced by the airlines, hence saving time. Travellers will also be able to select their journey type from either round trips or one way trips with an additional feature of multi-cities trip in the future releases. The system will allow the traveller to select the dates of departure and arrival in a very easy to see calendar view. They will also be able to include the number and type of travellers i.e., infants, children and adults. 

With these features the system will be able to display all the available flights tailored to the travellers requirements and arrange the flights from cheapest to most expensive to ease the travellers flight making decision. Once the traveller selects a flight of choice they will finalize the booking process by entering their personal information and will be prompted to proceed with payment which will direct the traveller to that airline's final reservation page ensuring secure transactions as they enter their payment information. Once the transaction is complete they will be able to receive their flight reservation information and itinerary. This information will be displayed on the system for future reference by the traveller. 

# Audience 
The ARS is primarily designed for airline travellers who need to be able to make travel plans anytime without the need of going to a travel agency or making bookings at constrained business hours at fixed locations. The ARS will be featuring domestic flights within Canada in its initial release featuring WestJet and Air Canada since these are the nationâ€™s major airlines. There will be the possibility of expansion to include other domestic airlines and also an expansion to account for international flights as well in future releases. 

# Value
The ARS displays multiple flights with corresponding prices, available seats which are further classified into classes like first class, premium economy, business and different prices are reserved for different classes and finally flight times so the travellers will be able to save money while also making a more informed flight decision. The system will also be easy to use for the travellers with its very minimal user interface which allows the traveller to only enter and view relevant information.

# Success Criteria
The system will be considered successful based on meeeting two criteriums. The first criteria is if the ratio of user searches converted to bookings is greater than 25% in the first three months of upload. The second success criteria is if the system has a very good and minimal user interface.
