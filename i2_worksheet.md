# Iteration 2 Worksheet

## Paying off technical debt


## SOLID

In the project of group3, I think the function addDetails violates Single Responsibility Principle, because it have multiple functions in it and maybe it can be broke in to several functions. Here is the [issue](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-3/my-awesome-project-a01-3/-/issues/55).

## Retrospective

Retrospective make us work on our codes more efficiently. We use **peer review** and **testing** to review our codes. <br/ >

In peer review, we try to explain the function of the code to other group members and discuss if there is a better solution. Also, when we find some bugs but cannot relsove them, we try to ask other members to review and explain the codes to help us find and fix bugs. <br/ >

In testing, one example is that when we run one of the test, we found a little typo of the string "Round trip", that "t" should be captical.

## Design patterns

### Adatper

[RecFlightsAdapter](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-4/team-flight-4/-/blob/development/flight/app/src/main/java/com/flight/presentation/RecFlightsAdapter.java)

[MainActivity](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-4/team-flight-4/-/blob/development/flight/app/src/main/java/com/flight/presentation/MainActivity.java)

We use Adpater in these 2 activity for showing list data.

### Builder

[MainActivity](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-4/team-flight-4/-/blob/development/flight/app/src/main/java/com/flight/presentation/MainActivity.java)

We use builder here to build a date picker.
